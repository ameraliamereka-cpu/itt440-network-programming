4. Methodology
A structured and repeatable testing process was used:
4.1 Non-GUI Execution
Tests were executed using:
.jmeter.bat -n -t testplan.jmx -l results.jtl -e -o report
This avoids GUI overhead and ensures accurate results.
4.2 JTL Data Analysis
All raw performance data was saved in JTL format. This allowed detailed analysis of every request made during testing.

4.3 Stable Network Environment
Recommended to get both client and server were operated on the same LAN network to minimize external latency.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 Repeated Runs
Each test was repeated multiple times. Only consistent and stable results were selected for final reporting.
Methodology Justification
A methodical approach ensures that performance data is reliable. By removing external variables and repeating tests, the final data becomes valid for deeper analysis and learning.
