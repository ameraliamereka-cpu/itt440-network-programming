1. A stable and controlled environment was prepared to ensure accurate and repeatable results. The following tools and components were Apache JMeter 5.6.3 . This is used to simulate user load and measure server performance. JMeter's has GUI and  non GUI mode , non GUI are more efficiency because its reduces overhead and provides more accurate results. Furthermore its easier to find the kb and the operation guide for beginner like me to start studies about pentest.

You can download it here : https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
Require the java 8+ to working.
Go to the C:\<Location where you extract>\ apache-jmeter-5.6.3\apache-jmeter-5.6.3\bin
Open the jmeter.bat to open the application

2. Kali Linux Server (Apache2 HTTPS)
My server runs on Kali Linux with an Apache2 HTTPS configuration. SSL/TLS encryption was enabled to simulate real-world encrypted traffic.

Step to Install apache for http in Kali Linux

Command	Remark
Sudo apt install apache2 openssl
	Install the apache2 in linux

Sudo a2enmod ssl
	Enable the ssl mode module

Sudo a2ensite default-ssl
	Enable the default ssl

Sudo systemctl restart apache2
	Restart the apache2 service

Sudo systemctl status apache2	
  Verify the apache2 service

3.PerfMon Server Agent
Used to capture CPU and memory usage during load execution. This provides deeper insight into system resource behavior.
Step to install jmeter agent in linux
Command	Remark
wget https://jmeter-plugins.org/files/ServerAgent-2.2.1.zip 
	Download files

unzip ServerAgent-2.2.1.zip
	Extract the file

cd ServerAgent-2.2.1
	Open the files

chmod +x startAgent.sh
	Change access permission 

./startAgent.sh	Start agent application
sudo systemctl status serveragent.service
	Verify the serveragent is running
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 10 Client Machine
All JMeter tests were executed from a Windows machine using PowerShell.
Justification of Tools Selection
These tools represent a realistic testing environment that a student might use when performing performance analysis. SSL traffic, remote testing, and resource monitoring help create a real-world scenario that closely mimics production like environments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firewall Configuration to Allow Connection
To ensure that Apache JMeter could communicate with the server during performance testing, the firewall on the server was configured to allow incoming connections on the necessary ports. In this case, the HTTPS service was operating on port 443, and the PerfMon Server Agent used port 4444 for CPU and memory monitoring. The firewall rules were updated using ufw to explicitly permit these port
	
sudo ufw status
	Status of the firewall
sudo ufw allow 4444/tcp 
sudo ufw allow 4444/udp
	Enable/allow port 4444/tcp/udp 
sudo ufw reload	Reload the rule
