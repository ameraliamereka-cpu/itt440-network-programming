Performance testing is an essential phase in evaluating how a server behaves under different levels of load. As a student conducting real-world server experiments, this report documents the complete performance evaluation of my own HTTPS server setup on my kali linux, hosted locally at https://192.168.129.130/ via virtual machine . The purpose of this study is to analyze how the server responds under normal load, sudden traffic spikes, and high intensity stress conditions.
The performance tests were carried out using Apache JMeter application, and each test focused on measuring key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, error rate, and percentile behavior. The server used for testing is self hosted and configured manually, making this report a practical technical study of server performance from a student's learning perspective for this assignment
