In conclusion, the performance evaluation conducted on my self hosted HTTPS server provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of how the system behaves under different traffic conditions. Through Load, Spike, and Stress testing using Apache JMeter, the server demonstrated strong stability and reliability during normal operations, as reflected by low average response times, consistent percentile values, and a 0% error rate across all tests. These results confirm that the core configuration of the server is well optimized for typical daily usage.
When subjected to sudden traffic increases during the Spike Test, the server showed expected performance degradation, with higher response times caused by the abrupt surge in concurrent requests. However, it continued to operate without failures, proving that the system is capable of handling unexpected short term load variations. Under the Stress Test, the server reached the upper limits of its capacity, resulting in reduced throughput and increased response times. Although performance declined under extreme conditions, the server remained functional, which indicates good fundamental stability even when pushed beyond its normal threshold.
Overall, the testing process highlights both the strengths and limitations of the server. The system performs well for moderate workloads but would benefit from further optimization such as reverse proxy caching, better resource allocation, and fine tuning of Apache worker configurations if it is expected to support higher or sustained loads in the future. This project has not only validated the operational capacity of the server but also provided valuable handson experience in real world performance testing, server optimization, and system analysis as a student managing my own infrastructure.
