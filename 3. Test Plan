3.1 Load Test
Simulates normal, steady user traffic. Used to measure baseline performance based on recommended setup:
Number of threads(users) : 50
Ramp up period (second) : 30
Loop count : infinite
Duration : 180 seconds

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 Spike Test
Simulates sudden and extreme increases in traffic. Useful to test resilience and stability. Base on recommendation here is my setting for spike test:
Number of threads(users) : 200
Ramp up period (second) : 300
Loop count : infinite
Duration : 180 seconds

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Stress Test
Pushes the server beyond its expected handling capability. Used to identify breaking points and bottlenecks. Base on recommendation , here is my setting for my stress test :
Number of threads(users) : 200
Ramp up period (second) : 300
Loop count : infinite
Duration : 180 seconds

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metrics Measured : Average Response Time, Percentiles (90th ,95th, 99th), Throughput (requests per second) , Error Rate and General server stability
Why These Tests are selected?
These three tests collectively provide a full picture of server behavior:
•	Load Test → normal behavior
•	Spike Test → resilience
•	Stress Test → endurance and capacity limit
