7. Bottlenecks Identified

Based on real measurements, the following bottlenecks were detected:
•	High CPU load due to SSL encryption
•	Apache worker thread saturation during heavy load
•	I/O latency when many requests arrive simultaneously
•	Absence of caching or reverse proxy mechanisms
These bottlenecks are expected for a single self-hosted server without optimization.
