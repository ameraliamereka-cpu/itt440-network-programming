8. Recommendations
8.1 Optimize Apache Worker Settings
Fine tuning MPM settings (MaxRequestWorkers, KeepAlive, ThreadsPerChild) can improve concurrency.
8.2 Add Reverse Proxy 
Helps reduce overhead and increases efficiency through caching and better load distribution. (e.g., Nginx)
8.3 Enable Gzip Compression
This reduces response sizes and speeds up delivery.
8.4 Increase Server Resources
More CPU cores or RAM would directly improve performance.
8.5 Continuous Monitoring
Running tools like HTOP, Netdata, or Prometheus helps detect early warning signs.
8.6 Consider Load Balancing 
If the system is expanded, using multiple servers behind a load balancer will greatly increase scalability.
